## User Journey
- The user logs in to the app using their Google account.
- The app requests authorization from Google to access the user's Gmail emails.
- The user grants permission to the app.
- The app receives an access token from Google.(this happens on the backend)
- The app redirects the user to the chatbot page.
- The user types a query into the chatbot.
- The chatbot processes the query and sends it to our API.
- The API returns a response to the chatbot.
- The chatbot displays the response to the user.
