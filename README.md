# Mail-QA
Mail QA is a chat-based web application that is focused on addressing the issue of professionals spending a significant portion of their workday on email communication. 
The proposed solution involves using generative AI to streamline email management and improve productivity.<br>
This repository contains the source code and development history of the ATRONS platform.

## Structure
- ```/API``` includes the code for the API powering the chatbot.
- ```/UI``` includes the frontend code.
- ```/public, /scripts and /src``` include the backend code

## How we are Solving the Problem
The proposed solution involves using generative AI specifically OpenAI models to streamline email management
and improve productivity. Here's a breakdown of the key components and tasks
involved:
- Understand the content of emails, including text extraction, language processing,
and context comprehension.
- Allow users to interact with the AI using natural language prompts and be
capable of interpreting these prompts to perform actions like summarizing emails,
searching for specific information, or generating responses..
- Generate concise summaries of emails based on user requests for example
extracting key points, identifying important information, and presenting it in a
user-friendly format..
- Understand the context of an email and generate appropriate and coherent
responses quickly and appropriately.
- Support 98 languages as currently supported by the OpenAI API ensuring that
users from diverse linguistic backgrounds can benefit from the AI-powered email
management and communication features.
- Have an intuitive user interface that allows users to input prompts, view
summaries, and access generated responses
